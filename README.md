## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned to not use "delete permanently" in VSCode while in WSL2 unless I really really want to delete something. I deleted my main component after I had almost finished it, so I had to rebuild it again from scratch since it got deleted and was not recoverable.

I also learned how to break things down to simple problems first, then add classes to style out the details. Get the overall responsive layout working first, then worry about the details.

### Useful resources

-   [Aligning items in a flex container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - This helped me understand how to align items in a flex column, I was having trouble aligning the Huddle logo with the rest of the column items before this simple article.
-   [Create Round Social Media Icons / Buttons using CSS
    [Create Round Social Media Icons](https://www.kodingmadesimple.com/2014/02/how-to-create-round-social-media-icon.html) - This helped me with the general idea of using a button for the social media icons, I was struggling with how to put a circle around the fontawesome icons.
